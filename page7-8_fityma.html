                all silverfishes, a few <br>
                minutes later, it happened <br>
                again. what can I even say <br>
                at this point? of course, <br>
                we were able to take them <br>

                was currently in a cave, <br>
                but I agreed. we arrived,<br>
                there was already too <br>
                much happening. I can't <br>
                even explain it properly; <br>
                there were skeletons, <br>
                slimes, potions, armor, <br>
                pottery shards, zombies, <br>
                you name it. it wasn't too <br>
                hard to survive, but we <br>
                didn't find anything that <br>
                valueable. when we came <br>
                back, I decided to log off.
