                I waited on an island with <br>

                didnt have the coords yet. <br>
                when he told us, we started <br>
                sailing. when we arrived, <br>
                they were all already <br>
                there. I put down my bed, <br>

                finally on his way back to <br>

                was easy, since I found a <br>
                lot of iron on the way to <br>
